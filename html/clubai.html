        <p>
          Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines,
          unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which
          involves consciousness and emotionality. The distinction between the
          former and the latter categories is often revealed by the acronym
          chosen. 'Strong' AI is usually labelled as AGI (Artificial General
          Intelligence) while attempts to emulate 'natural' intelligence have
          been called ABI (Artificial Biological Intelligence)Leading AI
          textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any
          device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize
          its chance of successfully achieving its goals.Colloquially.
